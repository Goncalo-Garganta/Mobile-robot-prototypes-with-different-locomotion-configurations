# Mobile-robot-prototypes-with-different-locomotion-configurations
Master's Thesis about mobile robot prototypes with different locomotion configurations

Robot vehicles are crucial nowadays for almost every industry, and there exists at least one in most factories. However, the wheel configuration on these robots presents a challenge since it may compromise the purpose of the robot if it is not adequate or less fitted.

This  dissertation will cover different configurations for mobility and compare them all while studying their advantages and disadvantages.

This deep look into the robot wheel configurations will allow us to understand their working better and possibly discover new applications for some of these configurations.

The aim of this work is to study the different control methods necessary to implement for each configuration, as well as the trajectory generation that is allowed by different configurations. Other comparison topics will be the influence the floor and slippage have on the robot depending on the configuration, the mechanical complexity of the wheel and the configuration itself, and the maximum load the robot can carry, all of which can affect the choice of configuration to use.

In order to do this, we will need to study the different algorithms in use today for trajectory planning, as well as analyze whether the different wheel configurations will affect the algorithms employed for the better or worse.

The prototypes built during the dissertation and the knowledge gained will be used to aid future classes studying robotics and autonomous systems.
